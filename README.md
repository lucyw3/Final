Calculate the surface integral(surface area).
When I started this course, I did not have much knowledge on coding. Infact, the only coding course I had taken I failed. 
I took this class to challenge myself and found the final project to be a great opprotunity to do so. 
I found an algorithm for solving 2-variable integrals. I took this algorithm and disected it, attempting to teach myself 
exactly how the code worked. In doing so, here are my findings:

1. A lot of coding depends on an input. For example in this code your entire answer depends on your integral as well as 
your bounds. Depending on the integral and bounds, you could get a completely different result. 
2.
