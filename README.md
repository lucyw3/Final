Final

Calculate the surface integral(surface area).
When I started this course, I did not have much knowledge on coding. Infact, the only coding course I had taken I failed. 
I took this class to challenge myself and found the final project to be a great opprotunity to do so. 
I wrote an algorithm for solving 2-variable integrals. While I wrote the code I made some small changes from examples I found online. I also set the colors to fit my personality. 
Here are a few things I realized when writing my code:

1. A lot of coding depends on an input. For example in this code your entire answer depends on your integral as well as 
your bounds. Depending on the integral and bounds, you could get a completely different result. 
2. Some coding I did at the beginning I realized could be condensed down so I did that. Some places that got changed were lines (58-59), (68-70), and (108-109). 
3. I also decided to include steps in the code. I find steps useful when I am trying to understand something so I figured maybe steps would help others understand my code better. 
4. Coding takes a long time. I first thought this code would be short and simple. But after I started I realized I needed to include steps as well as instructions with the coding. 


First the code asks you to parameterize your equation. If you don't have the correct parameters you won't get the right answer. After that the program will use your input function to find the partial derivatives, the vector product, and the magnitude. After that it will substitute your parameterizations in for f and find the integrand. Last it will find the intervals of integration by using the previously mentioned parametrization. After it calculates the integral it will output the answer. I included an example of this in the code. 

Some other notes:
I used the math class.
I used different fonts such as bold and italic.
I did use parts of code I found online when I got stuck. But most of this ended up changing anyways.
